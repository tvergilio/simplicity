# REST training day exercises

1. Add a new action to `CourseController` that lists the available courses as JSON
2. Add another new action that shows the details of a request course as JSON
3. Create functional tests for these actions
4. Add an action that accepts a student email address and a course code as JSON and registers that student to that course (don't worry about logging in)
5. Map your JSON endpoints to URLs beginning "/api/"
6. (Optional) make all these actions support XML as well via content negotiation
