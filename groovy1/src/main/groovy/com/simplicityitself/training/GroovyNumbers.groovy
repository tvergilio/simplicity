     * 1 and 1. Hence the third number is 2 (1 + 1) and the next is 3 (1 + 2).

     * <p>You can use any approach you want, including creating extra methods
     * in this class (particularly useful if you want to use recursion). If
     * you do want to use recursion and fancy a challenge, try making the
     * method tail recursive so it's fast and doesn't break for larger numbers.
     * See <a href="http://mrhaki.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/groovy-goodness-more-efficient-tail.html">this
     * article</a> for a quick primer.</p>
     *

     * numbers. Remember that <tt>int</tt> is only 32 bits, so can only hold
     * numbers up to and including 2,147,483,647. You'll have to change the
     * method signature to BigInteger to handle really large numbers.
     * See the Practical Groovy link mentioned in the class javadoc.</p>
     *
     * <p>To verify that your implementation can handle very large Fibonacci
     * numbers, uncomment the fib(20,000) data set from the <tt>GroovyNumbersSpec</tt>
     * test case.</p>
