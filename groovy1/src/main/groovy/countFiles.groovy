/**
 * TODO #36: (Advanced) Write a script that counts all the files in a target
 * directory that have a given suffix. The script should recurse into
 * subdirectories when counting. You should be able to launch the script with
 * the command line:
 *
 *     groovy countFiles.groovy <suffix>
 *
 * For a bit more of a challenge, you can support command line options that
 * change the criteria for the search. For example, --biggerthan <bytesize>
 * would find files larger than the given size.
 *
 * Don't forget that you can access the command line arguments from the
 * implicit script variabls `args`. This is an array of strings representing
 * THe arguments that come after the script file name.
